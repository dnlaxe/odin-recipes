    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ball of pizza dough (homemade or store-bought)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sliced pepperoni</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
        <li>Flour for rolling out the dough</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C) and place a pizza stone or baking sheet inside to heat.</li>
        <li>On a floured surface, roll out the pizza dough to your desired thickness. Transfer it to a piece of parchment paper for easy handling.</li>
        <li>Brush the dough lightly with olive oil, then spread the pizza sauce evenly over the surface, leaving a small border for the crust.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce, ensuring even coverage.</li>
        <li>Arrange the pepperoni slices on top of the cheese. Add oregano and red pepper flakes for extra flavor, if desired.</li>
        <li>Carefully transfer the pizza (with parchment paper) onto the preheated pizza stone or baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
        <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a couple of minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
    </ol>
